# project-landing-page
This is my first attempt at a landing page. I will be combining my previous HTML and CSS lessons to guide my website design, along with the basic content requirements as stated in the Odin Project guide that I am following.

The subject of the website was decided by a random topic generator so that I could focus more on stylistic choices, rather than thematic ones.

I may or may not revisit this project in the future!

I am eager to continue on my pathway, so once I have added the content required by the assignment, I probably will not go overboard on polishing the site. 

To any viewers, I wish you good health!

Alex.
